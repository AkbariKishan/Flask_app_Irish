# Model Deployment with Flask API

This repository includes the model deployment using Flask API.
Flask API is the most popular tool for machine learning model deployment. It is relatively simples yet expandable tool.

I have developed a simple multi-class classifier and integrated it into Flask environment for deployment purpose.
